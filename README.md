# Implementation-of-Algorithm-using-Qiskit
This project focuses on the implementation of four prominent quantum algorithms using Qiskit, a popular Python framework for quantum computing. The implemented algorithms include Grover's algorithm, Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, Shor's algorithm, and Fourier's algorithm.

Grover's Algorithm: Grover's algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that provides a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms. It can be used to find the solution to an unsorted database or to search for a specific item in a large dataset. The implementation of Grover's algorithm in Qiskit showcases its application in solving search problems.

Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm: The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is a quantum algorithm that solves the problem of determining whether a given function is constant or balanced. It demonstrates the advantage of quantum computation over classical computation for certain types of problems. The Qiskit implementation of this algorithm highlights its ability to efficiently solve this specific problem.

Shor's Algorithm: Shor's algorithm is a groundbreaking quantum algorithm for factoring large numbers exponentially faster than classical algorithms. It has significant implications for cryptography and the security of widely used encryption methods. The implementation of Shor's algorithm in Qiskit demonstrates its potential for breaking cryptographic systems based on integer factorization.

Fourier's Algorithm: Fourier's algorithm is a quantum algorithm that efficiently performs the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), a fundamental operation in signal processing and quantum algorithms. The Qiskit implementation showcases how Fourier's algorithm can be used to perform efficient transformations on quantum states.
